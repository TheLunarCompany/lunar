# MCPX Server

For MCPX documentation, see main [README](../../README.md)

## Webserver

MCPX exposes a backend for its companion UI when the `ENABLE_WEBSERVER=true` environment variable is passed. It will serve on :9001 when enabled.

You can connect using the [Demo Client](../../README.md#connecting-to-mcpx-with-demo-client) or via [Claude Desktop](../../README.md#from-claude-desktop).
