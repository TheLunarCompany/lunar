name: Queue
description: QueueProcessor introduces a delayed, priority-based queuing system. This plugin allows you to define a consumption rate by configuring the relevant quota ID, as well as priorities for different groups, ensuring that higher-priority requests are processed first. By using this plugin, requests will be delayed until their turn to proceed has arrived, or until the defined TTL is met.
