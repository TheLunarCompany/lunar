Feature: Strategy Based Throttling Remedy
    Scenario: Requests which exceed the limit defined by the remedy receive a rate limit error response
        Given API Provider is up
        And   Lunar Proxy is up
        When  policies.yaml file is updated
        And   policies.yaml includes a strategy_based_throttling remedy for GET httpbinmock /headers requests with 2 requests per 1 seconds
        And   policies.yaml file is saved
        And   apply_policies command is run without waiting for Fluent to reload

        And   next epoch-based 1 seconds window arrives
        
        And   3 requests are sent to httpbinmock /headers through Lunar Proxy
        
        And   next epoch-based 1 seconds window arrives

        And   1 request is sent to httpbinmock /headers through Lunar Proxy
        
        Then Responses have 200, 200, 429, 200 status codes in order

    Scenario: Requests which exceed the limit with spillover
        Given API Provider is up
        And   Lunar Proxy is up
        When  policies.yaml file is updated
        And   policies.yaml includes a strategy_based_throttling remedy for GET httpbinmock /anything requests with 2 requests per 1 seconds spillover is enabled
        And   policies.yaml file is saved
        And   apply_policies command is run without waiting for Fluent to reload

        And   next epoch-based 1 seconds window arrives

        And   1 request is sent to httpbinmock /anything through Lunar Proxy
        
        And   next epoch-based 1 seconds window arrives

        And   3 requests are sent to httpbinmock /anything through Lunar Proxy
        And   1 request is sent to httpbinmock /anything through Lunar Proxy
