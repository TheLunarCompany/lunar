Feature: Policies Reload
    Scenario: Valid policies reload
        Given   Lunar Proxy is up
        And     API Provider is up
        When    policies.yaml file is updated
        And     policies.yaml includes a fixed_response remedy for GET mox:8888 /json requests with status code 202
        And     policies.yaml file is saved
        And     apply_policies command is run without waiting for Fluent to reload
        And     A request to http:// mox :8888 /json is made through Lunar Proxy with header 'Early-Response: true'
        Then    Response has status 202

    # TODO: Check why there is a need to stop the Gateway

        And     Lunar Proxy is up
        And     mox is set to respond to GET /json with status 201

        And     policies.yaml includes a fixed_response remedy for GET mox:8888 /json requests with invalid config
        And     policies.yaml file is saved
        And     A local POST request (id apply_policies) is made to port 8081 at path /apply_policies
        And     A request to http:// mox :8888 /json is made through Lunar Proxy with header 'Early-Response: true'
