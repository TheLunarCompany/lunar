Feature: Lunar Proxy export HAR diagnosis made
    Background: Starts the Proxy
        Given   API Provider is up
        # The next 2 steps are madnatory in order to clean OTEL state.
        # TODO use future `reset` functionality instead and save some time ðŸ’ª

        And     Lunar Proxy is up
        
    Scenario: Request to a diagnosed endpoint is written
        Given   API Provider is up
        When    policies.yaml file is updated
        And     policies.yaml includes a har_exporter diagnosis for GET httpbinmock /anything/non_obfuscated_har/* requests with obfuscation disabled and without exclusions
        And     policies.yaml includes a s3_minio exporter with bucket_name: lunar-proxy-bucket and url: http://minio:9000
        And     policies.yaml file is saved
        And     apply_policies command is run
        And     A request to httpbinmock /anything/non_obfuscated_har/sensitiveData is made through Lunar Proxy
        Then    Transaction data is written
        And     Entry Status should be 200
        And     Entry Method should be GET
        And     Entry URL should be http://httpbinmock/anything/non_obfuscated_har/sensitiveData
