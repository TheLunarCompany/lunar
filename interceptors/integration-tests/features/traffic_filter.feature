    Scenario: Lunar Proxy is responsive and AllowList is filled
        Given Lunar Proxy is up
        And export LUNAR_PROXY_HOST=mox:9898
        And export LUNAR_HANDSHAKE_PORT=9898
        And export LUNAR_ALLOW_LIST=httpbinmock
        And client application is running
        And Mox path valid endpoint is set
        When client application makes an outgoing HTTP call
        Then response will return from Lunar Proxy

    Scenario: Lunar Proxy is responsive and BlockList is filled
        Given Lunar Proxy is up

        And export LUNAR_HANDSHAKE_PORT=9898
        And export LUNAR_BLOCK_LIST=httpbinmock
        And Lunar Proxy is up
        And client application is running
        And Mox path valid endpoint is set
        When client application makes an outgoing HTTP call
        Then response will return from original provider

    Scenario: Lunar Proxy is responsive and requests is sent to internal IP
        Given Lunar Proxy is up
        And export LUNAR_PROXY_HOST=mox:9898
        And export LUNAR_HANDSHAKE_PORT=9898
        And client application is running
        And Mox path valid endpoint is set
        When client application makes an outgoing HTTP call to internal IP
        Then response will return from original provider

    Scenario: Lunar Proxy is responsive and requests is sent to allowed internal IP
        Given Lunar Proxy is up
        And export LUNAR_PROXY_HOST=mox:9898
        And export LUNAR_HANDSHAKE_PORT=9898
        And export LUNAR_ALLOW_LIST=httpbinmock
        And client application is running
        And Mox path valid endpoint is set
        When client application makes an outgoing HTTP call to internal IP
        Then response will return from Lunar Proxy

    Scenario: Lunar Proxy is responsive and requests is sent with lunar interceptor header
        Given Lunar Proxy (logic support) is up
        And export LUNAR_PROXY_HOST=logic-mock-server:9000
        And export LUNAR_HANDSHAKE_PORT=9000
        And export LUNAR_ALLOW_LIST=httpbinmock
        And client application is running
        When client application makes an outgoing HTTP request and retrieves the incoming request's HTTP headers
        Then response will return from Lunar Proxy with incoming request's HTTP headers.

    Scenario: Lunar Proxy is responsive and requests is sent with lunar interceptor header based filter set true
        Given Lunar Proxy is up
        And export LUNAR_PROXY_HOST=mox:9898
        And export LUNAR_HANDSHAKE_PORT=9898
        And client application is running
        And Mox path valid endpoint is set
        When client application makes an outgoing HTTP call to internal IP with header based filter set as 'true'
        Then response will return from Lunar Proxy

    Scenario: Lunar Proxy is responsive and requests is sent with lunar interceptor header based filter set false
        Given Lunar Proxy is up
        And export LUNAR_PROXY_HOST=mox:9898
        And export LUNAR_HANDSHAKE_PORT=9898
        And client application is running
        And Mox path valid endpoint is set
        When client application makes an outgoing HTTP call to internal IP with header based filter set as 'false'
        Then response will return from original provider

    # We use this spesific flow to validate the remove of the header
    # as we can×³t validate this using the flow when the header sets to `false`

    Scenario: Request is sent with lunar interceptor header based filter and the header is deleted
        Given Lunar Proxy is up
        And export LUNAR_PROXY_HOST=mox:9898
        And export LUNAR_HANDSHAKE_PORT=9898
        And client application is running
        And Mox with headers endpoint is set
        When client application makes an outgoing HTTP request with header based filter and retrieves the request's HTTP headers
        Then response will not contain the header key 'x-lunar-allow'
