# Lunar Example Consumer App (Node.js)

This application is designed to demonstrate the use of Lunar Interceptor within a Node.js environment. Ensure you have Lunar Proxy running and properly configured to intercept and analyze the HTTP traffic generated by this app.
The Cat Fact API is provided by https://catfact.ninja/fact and is subject to its availability and rate limiting.

## Installation
Before running the app, ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. This app is compatible with Node.js versions 10.x and newer.

### Install Dependencies
**Lunar Interceptor**: The application requires the Lunar Interceptor to capture and analyze HTTP traffic. 
Install it using npm:

```bash
npm install lunar-interceptor@2.x.x
```

No additional dependencies are required for this app since it uses the native https and readline modules available in Node.js.

## Configuration
To run the client with Lunar Proxy, you need to set the LUNAR_PROXY_HOST environment variable. This variable should be set to the host or IP of the Lunar Proxy, including the port it is listening on.

For a typical setup, you can set this environment variable in your terminal session like so:

```bash
export LUNAR_PROXY_HOST="localhost:8000"
```

Replace `localhost:8000` with the actual address and port of your Lunar Proxy setup.

## Run Your App
After setting up the environment variable, you can run the application directly from your terminal:

```bash
node main.js
```
